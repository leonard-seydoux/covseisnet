**Covseisnet** is a Python package for array signal processing, with a focus on data from seismic networks. The central mathematical object of the package is the network covariance matrix, used for signal detection, source separation, localisation, and plane-wave beamforming. 

The core signal detection algorithms are based on the analysis of the spectrum of the network covariance matrix. Eigendecomposition provides a basis for signal detection and blind source separation. In addition, the covariance matrix can be used as input for classical array processing tools such as beamforming and inter-station cross-correlations. 

The package builts on the `ObsPy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/>`_ and `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_. The code repository is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/covseisnet/covseisnet and is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

Publication history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method was first introduced in :cite:`seydoux_detecting_2016` with an
application to the monitoring of the Piton de la Fournaise eruptions. We then
applied it to the analysis of USArray data in :cite:`seydoux_spatial_2016`. We then proposed a pre-processing method for ambient noise cross-correlations in :cite:`seydoux_pre-processing_2017`. The method was then applied to the detection and classification of seismovolcanic tremors in :cite:`soubestre_network-based_2018` and to the depth migration of seismovolcanic tremor sources in :cite:`soubestre_depth_2019`. The method was also applied to the study of localized modes on a metasurface in :cite:`lott_localized_2020`. Finally, the method was applied to the detection, classification, and location of seismovolcanic signals at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano in :cite:`journeau_detection_2020`.
