  abstract  = {ABSTRACT
               The seismic noise recorded by the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport (InSight) seismometer (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure [SEIS]) has a strong daily quasi-periodicity and numerous transient microevents, associated mostly with an active Martian environment with wind bursts, pressure drops, in addition to thermally induced lander and instrument cracks. That noise is far from the Earth’s microseismic noise. Quantifying the importance of nonstochasticity and identifying these microevents is mandatory for improving continuous data quality and noise analysis techniques, including autocorrelation. Cataloging these events has so far been made with specific algorithms and operator’s visual inspection. We investigate here the continuous data with an unsupervised deep-learning approach built on a deep scattering network. This leads to the successful detection and clustering of these microevents as well as better determination of daily cycles associated with changes in the intensity and color of the background noise. We first provide a description of our approach, and then present the learned clusters followed by a study of their origin and associated physical phenomena. We show that the clustering is robust over several Martian days, showing distinct types of glitches that repeat at a rate of several tens per sol with stable time differences. We show that the clustering and detection efficiency for pressure drops and glitches is comparable to or better than manual or targeted detection techniques proposed to date, noticeably with an unsupervised approach. Finally, we discuss the origin of other clusters found, especially glitch sequences with stable time offsets that might generate artifacts in autocorrelation analyses. We conclude with presenting the potential of unsupervised learning for long-term space mission operations, in particular, for geophysical and environmental observatories.},

  abstract  = {Slow slip events, observed in geodetic data, are occasionally associated with seismic signatures such as slow earthquakes (low-frequency earthquakes, tectonic tremors). In particular, slow earthquakes swarms tend to occur during slow slip events. This observation, possible thanks to the analysis of both seismic and geodetic data, allowed us to reveal the episodic behavior of slow slip events. Depending on the geological context, some slow slip events have no known related signature in seismic data, and other slow earthquakes can appear without any associated geodetic signature. Nevertheless, knowing the signature of such events in geodetic and seismic data would be of great interest since it would better inform us about the physical processes at play. In the present study, we propose identifying the classes of seismic signals that enable predicting the geodetic data with the best accuracy, including the slow slip events. We use a scattering network (a wavelet-based neural network) to extract relevant seismic signal features from continuous data. We attempt to predict the geodetic data from inferred seismic clusters or directly from a low-dimensional representation of the seismograms using a regression algorithm. This allows to (1) identify seismic signatures associated with slow slip events and (2) infer the contribution of each class to the overall displacement observed in the geodetic data. We compare our strategy on two subduction contexts where many slow-slip events are observed: the region of Guerrero, Mexico, and Northern Cascadia, Canada.},

               A large fraction of volcanic eruptions does not expel magma at the surface. Such an eruption occurred at Mt Ontake in 2014, claiming the life of at least 58 hikers in what became the worst volcanic disaster in Japan in almost a century. Tens of scientific studies attempted to identify a precursor and to unravel the processes at work but overall remain inconclusive. By taking advantage of continuous seismic recordings, we uncover an intriguing sequence of correlated seismic velocity and volumetric strain changes starting 5 months before the eruption; a period previously considered as completely quiescent. We use various novel approaches such as covariance matrix eigenvalues distribution, cutting-edge deep-learning models, and ascribe such velocity pattern as reflecting critically stressed conditions in the upper portions of the volcano. These, in turn, later triggered detectable deformation and earthquakes. Our results shed light onto previously undetected pressurized fluids using stations located above the volcano-hydrothermal system and hold great potential for monitoring.},

  abstract    = {Abstract. In the perspective of upcoming seasonally ice-free Arctic, understanding the dynamics of sea ice in the changing climate is a major challenge in oceanography and climatology. In particular, the new generation of sea ice models will require fine parameterization of sea ice thickness and rheology. With the rapidly evolving state of sea ice, achieving better accuracy, as well as finer temporal and spatial resolutions of its thickness will set new monitoring standards, with major scientific and geopolitical implications. Recent studies have shown the potential of passive seismology to monitor the thickness, density and elastic properties of sea ice with significantly reduced logistical constraints. For example, human intervention is no longer required, except to install and uninstall the geophones. Building up on this approach, we introduce a methodology for estimating sea ice thickness with high spatial and temporal resolutions from the analysis of icequakes waveforms. This methodology is based on a deep convolutional neural network for automatic clustering of the ambient seismicity recorded on sea ice, combined with a Bayesian inversion of the clustered waveforms. By applying this approach to seismic data recorded in March 2019 on fast ice in the Van Mijen fjord (Svalbard), we observe the spatial clustering of icequakes sources along the shore line of the fjord. The ice thickness is shown to follow an increasing trend that is consistent with the evolution of temperatures during the four weeks of data recording. Comparing the energy of the icequakes with that of calibrated seismic sources, we were able to derive a power law of icequake energy, and to relate this energy to the size of the cracks that generate the icequakes.},

  abstract   = {Theoretical demonstrations of the Green's function reconstruction from cross-correlations of the ambient noise rely on a strong hypothesis about the spatial homogeneity of the noise sources distribution. However, real seismic noise within the Earth is not homogeneously distributed. In particular, strongly coherent signals from earthquakes or localized noise sources might be harmful to the application of this method. Most of signal pre-processing techniques used to compensate for the wavefield inhomogeneity are based on temporal or spectral normalization of individual seismograms. Here we consider an approach based on simultaneous analysis of records from multiple sensors of a seismic array. We perform a time-frequency analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum of the covariance matrix. In a case of a wavefield dominated by a single noise source, the rank of the array covariance matrix is very low. Consequently, its eigenvalue spectrum contains a single dominant value. In a case of a well distribution of uncorrelated noise sources, the matrix rank increases and the eigenvalue spectrum is much broader. Therefore, we use the width of the eigenvalue spectrum as a measure of the level of the wavefield spatial coherence. The results are interpreted within the random matrix theory. We apply this approach on the wavefield recorded during the year 2010 by the USArray, and evaluate the effect of the energy normalization usually applied to single data prior to cross-correlation computation. We show that many coherent events resist to this normalization, and are still harmful to ambient noise tomography. We finally propose a new way to improve the energy normalization of data. We modify the eigenvalue spectrum of the covariance matrix to mitigate the effect of strong events. We show that cross-correlation symmetry is improved with this new technique, that may allow to use noise cross-correlations in zones where the seismic activity usually prevents the use of ambient seismic noise in the analysis of the Earth's crust.},

Nevertheless, our understanding of the deep roots of volcano-magmatic systems remains very limited. Here, we use the sources of seismovolcanic tremor to delineate the active part of the magmatic system beneath the Klyuchevskoy Volcanic Group in Kamchatka, Russia. The tremor sources are distributed in a wide spatial region over the whole range of crustal depths connecting different volcanoes of the group. The tremor activity is characterized by rapid vertical and lateral migrations explained by fast pressure transients and dynamic permeability. Our results support the conceptual model of extended and highly dynamic trans-crustal magmatic systems.

  abstract  = {Abstract
               The continuously growing amount of seismic data collected worldwide is outpacing our abilities for analysis, since to date, such datasets have been analyzed in a human-expert-intensive, supervised fashion. Moreover, analyses that are conducted can be strongly biased by the standard models employed by seismologists. In response to both of these challenges, we develop a new unsupervised machine learning framework for detecting and clustering seismic signals in continuous seismic records. Our approach combines a deep scattering network and a Gaussian mixture model to cluster seismic signal segments and detect novel structures. To illustrate the power of the framework, we analyze seismic data acquired during the June 2017 Nuugaatsiaq, Greenland landslide. We demonstrate the blind detection and recovery of the repeating precursory seismicity that was recorded before the main landslide rupture, which suggests that our approach could lead to more informative forecasting of the seismic activity in seismogenic areas.},
